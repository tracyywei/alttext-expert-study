In 1547 the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V defeated the Schmalkaldic League, an alliance of Protestant rulers. The Peace of Augsburg in 1555 brought recognition of the Lutheran faith.

Life[edit] He was born in Naples to a family that had originated in Gravina di Puglia. His father worked for the noblewoman Maria Milano, who encouraged Egizio towards studying classics. He then studied law, the subject in which he graduated. From a young age he divided his time between private tuition and attending Giuseppe Valletta's library, editing its catalogue.[1] He then became tutor to Antonio Carmine Caracciolo, prince of Torella, simultaneously becoming known for his knowledge of antiquities, so much so that he was often called on to interpret ancient coins and inscriptions and compose new inscriptions. He corresponded with  Anton Francesco Gori, Scipione Maffei, Apostolo Zeno, Bernard de Montfaucon and other intellectuals of the era[2] as well as joining Naples' Accademia degli Uniti and (with the pseudonym Timaste Pisandeo) Rome's Accademia dell'Arcadia and writing for the 'Giornale dei letterati'. He moved in libertine and anticurialist circles[1] but supported Naples' Bourbon rulers, leaving Naples after the Austrians' arrival in 1713 and moving to Amalfi. He later returned to live an isolated life in Naples, where he later died. Works[edit] Serie degl'imperadori romani distesa da Matteo Egizio.

Like his father George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, who had originated the efforts that led to the colony's charter, he was Catholic at a time when the Kingdom of England was dominated by the Church of England.[2] The Calverts intended the colony to function both as a haven for English Catholics fleeing religious persecution and as a source of income for themselves and their descendants.[3] Many of Maryland's first settlers were Catholic, including at least two Catholic priests, one of whom became the earliest chronicler of the colony's history.[4] But whatever Calvert's intentions, Maryland was a colony of an Anglican nation. Its charter had been granted by an Anglican king and seems to have assumed that the Church of England would be its official church. Eventually, Anglican and Puritan newcomers quickly came to outnumber the early Catholic settlers. Thus, by 1649 when the law was passed, the colonial assembly was dominated by Protestants, and the law was in effect an act of Protestant tolerance for Catholics, rather than the reverse.[3]","A painting of Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore.","A historical painting depicting a well-dressed man standing with a child and a servant.

Her ground strokes are very powerful.""[4] Yastremska is an aggressive baseline player, whose attacking style allows her to hit a large number of winners - she hit 33 winners in her first two finals, and 49 winners when she won her third title. Her highly aggressive playing style also lends itself to a high unforced error count, with Yastremska hitting 21, 53, and 50 unforced errors in her three final matches.[30][34][35] As of the 2019 Australian Open, Yastremska was ranked as the most aggressive player on the WTA Tour, having led the tour with 28.6 per cent of her shots ending in a winner, an unforced error, or an opponent's forced error; this statistic is known as the Aggression Score.[76][77][78] Yastremska's groundstrokes are hit with relentless power, depth, and speed, with her forehand being her best shot, due to the extreme amount of racquet head speed she creates. She is capable of winning a high percentage of points when she hits an inside-in forehand in particular, and she can hit winners from any position of the court with her forehand.[79] Despite this, Yastremska also possesses an incredibly powerful backhand, which is typically hit flat, allowing her to hit sharply angled winners. She can also strategically apply slice to her backhand, allowing her to break up the pace of rallies and construct points intelligently. Her average first serve speed is about 100 miles per hour (160 km/h), although her first serve speed can scale 116 mph (187 km/h), allowing her to serve numerous aces in any match.[80] Although she ranked in the top 20 on the WTA Tour in aces in 2019, she also ranked in the top 10 in double faults, as she tends to take risks on her second serve.[81]",Yastremska swinging a forehand,"A tennis player in a colorful blue and green dress is preparing to hit a forehand shot on a hard court.

These included colza oil (Argand lamp), kerosene/paraffin, and gas.[63] Due to its brightness, gas was initially only used for public lighting, later it also appeared in homes.[64] As gas lighting caught on, branched ceiling fixtures called gasoliers (a portmanteau of gas and chandelier) were produced. Many candle chandeliers were converted. Gasoliers may have only slight variations in the decorations from chandeliers, but the arms were hollow to carry the gas to the burners.[8] Examples of gasoliers were the extravagant chandeliers in the Royal Pavilion in Brighton first installed in 1821.[62] While popular, gas lighting was considered too bright and harsh on the eyes, and lacking the pleasing quality of candlelight.[65] Shades that surround the gas light were then added to reduce the glare. Gas lighting was eventually replaced by electric light bulbs in the early 20th century.[66]",Chandeliers in the Banqueting Room of Royal Pavilion were lit by oil and gas[62],"A large, ornate chandelier with intricate detailing and multiple layers of crystal hangs from a decorative ceiling.

Any spectral peculiarity is denoted this way, such as the Y-band peak and Y-J color of WISE 1639−6847 (Y0pec), which is different from other Y-dwarfs.[22] In some cases the peculiarity is explained with a non-solar metallicity or an unusual surface gravity. An example is CWISE J1055+5443, for which researchers find that low gravity models fit the spectrum better, likely due to a young age.[23] JWST observations found two Y-dwarfs with unusual spectral features of the carbon-bearing molecules. CWISEP J1047+54 showed abnormally strong CO and CO2 and likely weaker CH4.[13] Similar strong CO and CO2 absorption features were found in WISE J1206+8401.[15] WISE J0535−75 on the other hand showed no discernable CO2 and almost undetectable CO, but it also showed stronger NH3 absorption when compared to Y-dwarfs with similar temperature.[13] Another notable spectral discovery with JWST is the emission of methane in CWISEP J1935-1546, which is interpreted with the presence of an aurora.[24] One of the first suspected Y-type subdwarfs is WISEA J1534−1043, which shows an unusual blue color.

Joan Witte contends that he opposed the practice except when it was wielded by the party and the Red Army after 1917.[24] She also suggests that he opposed the use of terrorism as a mindless act but endorsed its use in order to advance the communist revolution.[24] Chaliand and Blin contend that Lenin advocated mass terror but objected to disorderly, unorganized, or petty acts of terrorism.[22] According to Richard Drake, Lenin had abandoned any reluctance to use terrorist tactics by 1917, believing that all resistance to communist revolution should be met with maximum force. Drake contends that the terrorist intent in Lenin's program was unmistakable, as acknowledged by Trotsky in his book Terrorism and Communism: a Reply, published in 1918.[25] In the book, Trotsky provided an elaborate justification for the use of terror, stating ""The man who repudiates terrorism in principle, i.e., repudiates measures of suppression and intimidation towards determined and armed counterrevolution, must reject all ideas of the political supremacy of the working class and its revolutionary dictatorship.""[23] Trotsky's justification largely rests on a criticism of the usage of the term ""terrorism"" to describe all political violence on behalf of the Left, but not equally vicious political violence carried out by  liberal or reactionary factions.[26] Scholars on the Left argue that while it is a matter of historical record that communist movements did at times employ violence, the label of ""terrorism"" is disproportionately used in Western media sources to refer to all political violence employed by the left, while similarly violent tactics employed by the United States and its allies remain unscrutinized.[27][28]","Bolshevik banner in 1918: ""Death to the Bourgeoisie and its lapdogs – Long live the Red Terror!!""","A historical black and white photograph shows a group of people standing in front of a building, holding a large banner with Cyrillic text.

Two of the warships, Mersey and Severn, armed with a pair of 6 in (152 mm) guns each, were brought from Britain.[31] Königsberg had in the meantime been moved a third time, even further upriver.[19] On 6 July 1915, the two monitors crossed the outer sandbar and steamed up the river, despite heavy fire from German positions on the river banks. They stopped at a point they thought to be 10,000 yd (9,100 m) from Königsberg, which would be in range of their own guns but farther than the smaller German guns could reply. Aircraft were used to spot the fall of shot. The monitors' navigation was faulty, however, and after opening fire, they found themselves to be within range of Königsberg's guns.[31] She hit Mersey twice in the engagement; one shell disabled the forward 6-inch gun, and another holed the ship below the waterline. Königsberg was hit four times in return, one shell striking beneath the waterline and causing some flooding.[32] In the span of three hours, Königsberg forced both British ships to withdraw.[31]",Königsberg gun in the field (1916),"Vintage black and white photo depicting soldiers setting up artillery, such as cannons, in a forested area.

In July 1915, she was transferred to Mudros to attempt to penetrate the Dardanelles. After making a reconnaissance flight over the straits and having studied the reports of the British submarines that had successfully entered the Dardanelles, Lieutenant de vaisseau Auguste Farbre ordered his crew to cast off on the evening of 25 July. Escorted by the French destroyer Poignard to the mouth of the Dardanelles, she rounded Cape Helles on the surface, but dived to avoid being spotted by a searchlight about an hour later and attempted to pass underneath a minefield near Çanakkale. The boat became entangled in the cables and when she surfaced in an unsuccessful attempt to free herself, she was immediately engaged by a Turkish gun battery at close range. Mariotte could not submerge because her conning tower had been penetrated by shells so Farbre decided to scuttle the boat and surrender. The Turks ceased fire when he signaled his surrender and so his crew was able to destroy documents and equipment before opening the seacocks to sink the submarine. The wreck lies off Cape Nara near a Turkish naval base at a depth of 5 meters (16 ft).[9]","The crew lined up at Mudros, July 1915",Alt-text: A historical black and white photo of a naval vessel on the water.
